  Psychodiagnostic evaluations provide diagnostic clarity,
  comprehensive treatment recommendations, and evaluation of individual clinical needs. Such evaluations can be conducted for individuals in the criminal or civil system, and can be useful when an individual is seeking a second opinion regarding a diagnosis or when a  treatment provider requires a more thorough assessment to diagnose and treat an individual under their care.
