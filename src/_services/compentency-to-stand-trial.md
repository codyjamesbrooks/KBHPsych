  An evaluation of a defendantâ€™s competency to stand trial provides an opinion on whether, (due to mental illness or developmental disorder) a defendant lacks a factual and rational understanding of the proceedings against them, and/or does not possess the ability to consult with legal counsel and assist in their own defense. While most initial competency evaluations are conducted by state evaluators, the court may specifically request a private evaluator to conduct the evaluation. It is also common for private evaluators to conduct second-opinion evaluations, when an objection is raised regarding the initial report.
