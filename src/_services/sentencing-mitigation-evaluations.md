  Sentencing mitigation reports are generally requested by defense counsel to provide the court with a summary of potential mitigating factors within an individual’s history and to provide context for their current and historical functioning. Such evaluations are often utilized when a defendant is unlikely to meet statutorily defined criteria for mental condition or sanity defenses, but exhibits mental health symptoms, substance use, or other personal issues that may have impacted behavior around the time of the alleged offenses.
