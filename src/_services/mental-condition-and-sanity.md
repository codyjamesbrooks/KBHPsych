  Colorado Statute defines a person who is Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI) as "A person who is so diseased or defective in mind at the time of the commission of the act as to be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to that act" or "A person who suffered from a condition of mind caused by mental disease or defect that prevented the person from forming a culpable mental state that is an essential element of a crime charged" (CRS § 16-8-101.5). All sanity evaluations include an  evaluation of a defendant’s competency to proceed. For individuals charged with a class 1 or 2 felony, or felony sex offense, video recording of the evaluation is required and must be preserved.
