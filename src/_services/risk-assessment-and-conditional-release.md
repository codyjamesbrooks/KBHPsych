  Risk assessment is concerned with the identification of individual factors that are known to exhibit association with violent, sexual, or recidivistic behaviors. While the evaluation of established risk factors can aid in predicting, managing, and mitigating an individual’s future risk, a person’s specific future risk of violence and/or recidivism also depends on situational factors that cannot be known in advance. Assessment of an individual’s risk can be conducted as a standalone evaluation, or can be embedded in a larger report (e.g., sentencing
  mitigation).

  Risk assessments are routine in the area of conditional release evaluations for defendants found not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI). Once a defendant has been found NGRI and committed to a forensic hospital, the burden of proof rests with the defendant to prove by preponderance of the evidence that no abnormal mental condition exists that would be likely to cause the defendant to be dangerous either to himself or herself or to others or to the community in the reasonably foreseeable future. As such, a conditional release evaluation speaks to clinical diagnosis as well as risk for future violence. Such evaluations are routinely conducted by individuals can also request and submit independent evaluations alongside those conducted by the state.
