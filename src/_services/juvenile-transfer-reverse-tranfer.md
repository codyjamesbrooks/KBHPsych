  In the state of Colorado, the District Attorney’s office may elect to charge and sentence a juvenile offender in adult district court, given particulars surrounding the nature of the alleged offense, individual criminal history, and provided the juvenile is 16 years of age at the time of the incident. This strategy is known as a “direct file.” In response, defense counsel may submit a motion to have the juvenile “reverse transferred” to juvenile court. In these cases, the court is statutorily required to consider several factors including:

  1. The age of the juvenile and the maturity of the juvenile as determined by considerations of the juvenile's home, environment, emotional attitude, and pattern of living;

  2. The current and past mental health status of the juvenile as evidenced by relevant mental health or psychological assessments or screenings that are made available to both the district attorney and defense counsel;

  3. The likelihood of the juvenile's rehabilitation by use of the sentencing options available in the juvenile courts and district courts.
