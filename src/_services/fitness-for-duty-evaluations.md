  Fitness for duty evaluations are tailored to the specific demands, role, and responsibilities of the individual being evaluated. In general, such
  assessments require thorough record review, administration of psychological testing, and occasionally risk, or threat assessment. The content and structure of the evaluation is tailored to the needs and requirements of the institution requesting the assessment.
